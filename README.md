## How to Run

To run the React.js application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Start the Development Server:**

    Run the following command to start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the development server and automatically open the application in your default web browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

2. **Build for Production:**

    If you want to build the application for production, run:

    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

    This command bundles the app into static files for production. The build folder is ready to be deployed.

3. **Run Tests:**

    To run tests, execute:

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

    This launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

4. **Other Scripts:**

    You can find other useful scripts in the `package.json` file. For example, you can run the linter with:

    ```bash
    npm run lint
    ```

    Or check for security vulnerabilities with:

    ```bash
    npm run audit
    ```
